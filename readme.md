# photoGallery

A couple of photo galleries that I have stiched together from examples and inspiration from the web.
So what are the differant galleries that are in this repo?

## simple

As the name says its a pretty simple gallery. A bit of fade between slides and some buttons! WOOT WOOT buttons. Check out the index pages for a simple demo.

## simple-dots

The simple gallery with a dot indicator and captions functionality for each of the images.

## wip

A much more complex photo gallery with touch feature and the full shabang, that said it is much more tempremental, hence the name wip (work in progress)
